##### Abstract
Despite the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of
human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection, approximately 50% of
therapeutically adherent patients continue to present with mild neurological
deficits, collectively referred to as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(HAND). As a potentially important component in the development of HAND,
genetic variation in the HIV-1 accessory protein Tat has been demonstrated to
result in altered protein structure and function. This study evaluates the
relationship between HIV-1 Tat amino acid substitutions and HIV-1-associated
neurocognitive impairment (NI) in the Drexel CNS AIDS Research and
Eradication Study (CARES) cohort in Philadelphia, PA. NI was assessed using a
Comprehensive Neuropsychological Assessment (CNPA) to distinguish between
impaired and non-impaired individuals. PBMC-derived HIV-1 Tat exons 1 and/or
2 sequenced from amplified integrated proviral DNA were sequenced using
Illumina-based next generation sequencing (NGS) for 117 patients (66 impaired,
51 non-impaired). Amino acid diversity was calculated at both the intrapatient
and interpatient level, indicating a largely homogenous HIV-1 Tat population
within patients but substantial amino acid variation between patients. The
performance of machine learning-based screening algorithms based on HIV-1
genetic features were compared against algorithms using only standard clinical
features. These algorithms utilized regularized logistic regression, and were
validated using 5-fold cross validation. An algorithm including both the top clinical
and genetic features was also developed and achieved a mean area under the
ROC curve (AUC) of 0.74 +/- 0.03, outperforming the top baseline models
incorporating only genetic or clinical features. This performance provides strong
preliminary support that integration of NGS data of HIV-1 Tat and other genes
may yield improvements to clinical screening tools, as well as allow the statistical
inference of genetic variants associated with NI.
